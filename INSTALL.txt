 Before building fizmo you want might to take look at the configuration
 settings.  Configuration is done by providing a "config.mk" file, which is
 easiest obtainable by copying a template like "config.default.mk" to
 "config.mk" and then modifying values.

 To start the acutal build, simply invoke "make". If successful, this will
 build the "fizmo-console" and "fizmo-ncursesw" binaries.

 To install the files, invoke "make install" to copy these to the location
 indicated using "INSTALL_PREFIX" in the config.mk file. This will create
 a "bin" or "games", "man" and "share" directories at the destination
 location.
