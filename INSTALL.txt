 Before building fizmo you want might to take look at the configuration
 settings.  Configuration is done by providing a "config.mk" file, which is
 easiest obtainable by copying a template like "config.default.mk" to
"config.mk" and then modifying values. "config.default.mk" should work
 out-of-the-box on most linux -- and possibly also other unix -- installations,
 the "config.macports.mk" allows building on Mac OS X which have MacPorts
 installed.

 By default, the build relies on the following dependendies:
  - pkg-config is used by the configuration itself to get the build flags
    for most other packages.
  - libfizmo requires libxml2 for .ifiction parsing.
  - libsndifsdl needs sdl-sound and sndfile (the latter one for AIFF-support).
  - libdrilbo relies on X11, Xext, libpng and libjpeg for graphics output.
  - fizmo-ncursesw needs an ncurses-wide build to compile.

 With the exception of libxml2, ncurses and libjpeg these should be
 automatically located using pkg-config if they're available. The three
 packages just mentioned often don't provide information for pkg-config,
 so if they're not in a standard location on your system you might have
 to adjust the appropriate NONPKG-variables.

 General information on building can be obtained by invoking "make" without
 arguments.

 To install the files, invoke "make install" to copy these to the location
 indicated using "INSTALL_PREFIX" in the config.mk file. This will create
 a "bin" or "games", "man" and "share" directories at the destination
 location.
