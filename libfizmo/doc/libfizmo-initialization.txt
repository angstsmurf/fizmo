 Overview

 There are six initialization steps:

  1. fizmo_register_screen_interface
  2. fizmo_register_sound_interface
 [3. optional: parse_fizmo_config_files]
  4. fizmo_start
  5. (parse_fizmo_config_files if not happened before)
 [6. implicit: link_active_interface_to_story]


 fizmo config files:

 1. /etc/fizmo.conf, always parsed.
 2. All "fizmo/config" files in all directories from colon-spearated
    XDG_CONFIG_DIRS path.
 3. $HOME/.config.fizmo



 Color initialization

 The screen default colors are stored in variables "default_foreground_colour"
 and "default_background_colour" inside "output.c". By default, the foreground
 is initialized as white, the background as black. Initialization is as
 follows:

 1. By default, the foreground color is set to white, the background to
    black in "output.c".
 2. The screen interface's functions "get_default_foreground_colour" and
    "get_default_background_colour" are evaluated. In case these return
    valid z_colour values, these are used as the default colors. That means
    that by returning -1 for one or both of the functions, the screen
    interface may choose not to alter the interpreter's default values.
 3. The "foreground-color" and "background-color" config variables are
    evaluated from the configuration file(s).
 4. The "fizmo-start" function's variables "screen_default_foreground_color"
    and "screen_default_background_colour" are evaluated. In case these
    contains valid z_colour values, they're used as the new default. As in
    step 2, that means that the default, as evaluated up to this step, may
    be kept by setting one or both of the values to -1.

 Why the additional step 4? While it's already possible to read color
 information from the screen interface in step 2, step 4 ensures that it's
 possible to still override the information parsed from the config files
 in step 3 from the screen interface.
