 libfizmo configuration option names
 2010-11-22





 Overview

 This file lists all available configuration file options. Please note that
 these option names may not be valid for the actual interface command line
 options, which may be named otherwise for convenience.


 Syntax

 Every option must be listed on a separate line. Lines starting with a # are
 interpreted as comments and not evaluated. For some options, a value may
 be supplied, in which case option name and value are separated by a = sign,
 for example: "left-margin = 1".
 

 Variables

 Option values may contain variables. Variables start with a dollar sign $
 and are enclosed by parantheses. Example: $(VARIABLE_NAME). The only currently
 implemented variable is $(HOME), which refers to the current user's home
 directory.



 List of valid libfizmo option names and values

 locale = <locale-name>
 Defines which language settings libfizmo should use by default. The standard
 setting is "en_US".

 savegame-path = <directory-name>
 Gives the directory name where savegames are read from and written to. Should
 be specified as an absolute directory file name.

 transscript-filename = <filename>
 Specifies the default filename for the transcript file. Especially useful
 when "start-script-when-story-starts" is enabled, so that transcripting
 may always start directly without asking for a filename.

 start-script-when-story-starts
 When selected, stream 2 will be enabled directly from the story start. This
 allows a user to capture a full transscript of the story, including the
 introductional text.

 sync-transcript
 When enabled, this option will try to flush and fsync output to the
 trankscript file as soon as possible.

 start-command-recording-when-story-starts
 (?)

 command-filename = <filename>
 (?)

 start-file-input-when-story-starts
 (?)

 random-mode = <random | predictable>
 By default, the random-mode is always set to "random", meaning that the
 randomizaion generator will try to deliver random numbers. When set to
 "predictable", the generator will always deliver the same range of
 numbers, as defined in the Z-Specification[1] section 2.4.2.

 foreground-color = <color-name>
 This sets a custom foreground color. The color name must be one out of
 black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white.

 background-color = <color-name>
 This sets a custom background color. The color name must be one out of
 black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white.

 enable-color
 Force libfizmo to enable color mode, even if the output interface reports
 that it cannot handle color.

 disable-color
 Force libfizmo to disabled color mode, even if the output interface reports
 that color is available.

 quetzal-umem
 Force libfizmo to write savegames in an uncompressed memory format. See
 quetzal appendix in the Z-Specification[1], section 3.

 force-8bit-sound
 (?)

 disable-sound
 Force libfizmo to not play any sound.

 set-tandy-flag
 Set the tandy flag in the story header. For more information about the flag,
 see http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/infocom/info/tandy_bits.html.
