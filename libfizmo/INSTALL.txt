  --- libfizmo Installation ---


 Before building libfizmo you want might to take look at the configuration
 settings.  Configuration is done by providing a config.mk file, which is
 easiest by copying a template like "config.default.mk" to "config.mk" and
 then modifying values.

 The DEFAULT_PREFIX, DEFAULT_LIB_PREFIX and DEFAULT_INC_PREFIX defined
 where the standard includes and libraries should be read from and can
 usually be left on default settings. LIBXML2_INC_DIR and LIBXML2_LIB_DIR
 defined the locations for libxml2 files which can usually also be left
 on default. The "INSTALL_PREFIX" defines the standard prefix where installed
 files should be written to.

 To start the acutal build, simply invoke "make". If successful, this will
 create the "libfizmo.a" library as well as the make-configuration-files
 "libfizmo.mk" and "libcellif.mk".

 To install the files, invoke "make install" to copy these to the location
 indicated using "INSTALL_PREFIX" in the config.mk file. This will create
 "include", "lib" and "share" directories at the destination location.
